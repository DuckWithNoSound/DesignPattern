3. [REFACTOR] – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
4. [DOCS] – updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files
5. [STYLE] – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
